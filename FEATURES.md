# Ethereum Archive — Feature Breakdown

*Detailed feature list from vision sessions. Keep this up to date.*

## Core Concept

**Three-part nature:**
1. **Educational** — teach what Ethereum is and why it matters
2. **Historical/Architectural** — document design evolution and tradeoffs
3. **Art** — visually compelling, almost meditative experience

**Key insight:** The blockchain IS a clock. Everything indexed by block numbers, not just dates.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation

### Timeline Core
- [x] Static timeline with text + links
- [x] Block-indexed events (timestamp → block number conversion) — backend has block_time.rs
- [x] Era markers (Frontier → Homestead → Metropolis → etc.)
- [x] Basic detail panels for each event
- [x] Block numbers moved to bottom right of detail panel
- [x] Support for approximate blocks with tilde (~) prefix
- [x] **Deep linking** — URL hash routing (e.g., `#the-merge`) opens and scrolls to event

### 🔢 Block Numbers for All Events (TODO)
**Every event needs a block number.** For events without an exact block:
1. Look up the date/time of the event
2. Find the approximate block at that timestamp
3. Add `blockNumber` with `approximateBlock: true` to show tilde (~)

Events needing block numbers:
- [x] Whitepaper (Nov 27, 2013) — pre-genesis, omitted (before block 0)
- [x] Bitcoin Miami announcement (Jan 26, 2014) — pre-genesis, omitted
- [x] The Spaceship (June 2014) — pre-genesis, omitted
- [x] Crowdsale (July 22, 2014) — pre-genesis, omitted
- [x] DevCon 0-7 — all have approximate block numbers
- [x] Vitalik blog posts — all 4 have approximate block numbers
- [x] CryptoKitties congestion (Nov 28, 2017) — ~4,605,000
- [x] DeFi Summer/Compound (June 15, 2020) — ~10,300,000
- [x] Beeple NFT sale (March 11, 2021) — ~12,020,000
- [x] L2 launches (Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, zkSync, Linea, Scroll) — all have blocks
- [x] Raiden Network, Plasma whitepaper dates — have approximate blocks
- [x] Yearn Finance launch — ~10,500,000
- [x] ENS launch — has exact block 3648571
- [x] MakerDAO launch — ~4,750,000
- [x] Uniswap V1 launch — ~6,640,000

**Tool:** Use Etherscan's block-by-timestamp: `https://etherscan.io/block?t=UNIX_TIMESTAMP`

### Data Sources
- [x] ethereum/EIPs repo integration — backend has github.rs
- [x] ethereum/pm repo (AllCoreDevs notes, upgrade specs) — backend scaffolded
- [x] Hard fork block numbers (static, well-documented) — in timeline.ts
- [x] Vitalik's blog posts (manual curation initially) — Added 4 key essays

### Tagging System
Tags: `protocol`, `scaling`, `defi`, `nft`, `social`, `research`, `security`
- [x] Tag each event — Tag type + tags field added
- [x] Filter by tags — TagFilter.tsx component created
- [x] Presets: "Protocol Deep Dive" / "DeFi Journey" / "Full Experience"

### Content Tracks
**Protocol layer:**
- Hard forks, EIPs, upgrades
- Architectural decisions

**Application layer:**
- MakerDAO (early DeFi, DAI stablecoin)
- CryptoKitties (congestion wake-up call)
- Uniswap (AMM breakthrough, DeFi summer)
- Compound, Aave (lending)
- OpenSea, NFT boom
- ENS (identity layer)

**Failed/abandoned attempts (educational):**
- Raiden Network (state channels, eclipsed by rollups)
- Plasma (data availability issues)

---

## Phase 2: Animation

### "On Rails" Mode
- [x] Click play, watch Ethereum evolve — AutoPlay.tsx
- [x] Auto-scroll through timeline — smooth animation
- [x] Pause/resume controls — detects manual scroll to auto-pause
- [ ] Blocks with connectors marching forward (future: add block animation)

### Visual Effects
- [ ] Hard forks as visual events (chain diverging for ETC split)
- [ ] L2s appearing in background/distance as they launch
- [ ] Visual complexity grows as ecosystem grows
- [ ] Merge glow effect at block 15,537,394

### L2 Chain Visualization
- [x] Faded lines in background — L2Chains.tsx
- [x] Lines tied to specific milestones (not arbitrary)
- [x] Full-length lines (from milestone to bottom of page)
- [x] Optimism (red), Arbitrum (blue), Base (blue), zkSync, Linea, Scroll
- [x] Historical: Plasma, Raiden (very faded - abandoned)
- [x] ETC fork as first branch (most faded - ancient history)
- [x] Horizontal connectors from main line to branches
- [x] Unique shimmer effects per chain (slow/medium/fast/pulse/wave)
- [x] Age-based opacity (older = more faded)
- [x] The Merge glow effect
- [x] Dencun/4844 milestone glow
- [x] **Beacon Chain** — parallel line (orange, more solid) that curves and merges into mainline at The Merge
- [x] SVG curve for smooth Beacon Chain → mainline merge animation
- [x] **Hard fork ghost branches** — short dashed curves at each fork that fade out (the "old chain" that died)
- [x] **Rainbow effect at timeline end** — L2 lines get brighter/glowier as you scroll toward present
- [x] **Live section shimmer** — main line pulses/shimmers only in the live block section (bottom 8%); solid elsewhere

---

## Phase 3: Immersive

### Live Block Feed
- [x] Bottom of timeline = "Now" — LiveBlockFeed.tsx
- [x] WebSocket connection for real-time blocks (with polling fallback)
- [x] Links to Etherscan for details
- [x] Historical becomes present
- [x] Older blocks fade, newest at bottom (highlighted)
- [x] Auto-cycles without scrolling

### Future History Section
- [x] "The history that hasn't happened yet" — FutureHistory.tsx
- [x] Upcoming upgrades: Pectra, Verkle, Danksharding, Single Slot Finality
- [x] Status badges (Planning/Testing/Scheduled)
- [x] Links to Forkcast and specs

### Audio Layer
- [x] Play/pause button (bottom left, unobtrusive) — AudioPlayer.tsx
- [x] Yuri Petrovski "The Cyberpunk Runner" via YouTube embed
- [ ] Music evolves as you scroll through eras (future enhancement)
  - Early Ethereum = minimal/ambient
  - DeFi summer = more intense
  - Present = full cyberpunk

### Embedded Media
- [ ] Audio clips at key moments (Vitalik introducing rollup roadmap)
- [ ] Video embeds from DevCon talks
- [ ] Sound effects for animations
- [ ] Primary sources > summaries

- [ ] **More regional events** — Ongoing additions

Include: dates, locations, notable announcements, links to recordings/recaps.

---

### Early History Research (The Cryptopians)
**Task:** Review Laura Shin's "The Cryptopians" for pre-launch events to add.

Key events to research and add:
- [ ] Co-founder dynamics and departures (Charles Hoskinson leaving, etc.)
- [x] Legal formation (Ethereum Foundation in Switzerland) — Stiftung Ethereum, Zug, July 2014
- [x] Olympic testnet (May 2015) — Added with bounty program details
- [ ] Vitalik's early Bitcoin Magazine articles
- [ ] More detail on The Spaceship period
- [x] Yellow Paper publication (Gavin Wood) — Added with links to PDF and GitHub
- [ ] Early community formation

### AllCoreDevs Calls (Big Task)
**Add ALL ACD calls to the timeline as filterable events.**

Data sources:
- `ethereum/pm` repo — meeting notes in markdown
- Forkcast.org — structured call data
- YouTube — recordings

Implementation:
- Automate ingestion from ethereum/pm repo
- Each call becomes a timeline event with type `acd_call`
- Tag: `protocol`
- Links: YouTube recording, meeting notes, agenda
- Filter toggle to show/hide ACD calls (there are 200+)

This is a data aggregation task — perfect for the Rust backend.

---

## Architecture

### Data Pipeline (Pre-populated, not on-the-fly)
**Principle:** Avoid fetching data at runtime. Pre-populate static JSON files.

```
scripts/fetch-data/
├── fetch-gas-prices.ts    # Historic gas from Etherscan API
├── fetch-eth-prices.ts    # Historic ETH/USD from CoinGecko
├── fetch-blob-data.ts     # Blob stats from Dune/BlobScan
├── fetch-l2-tvl.ts        # L2 TVL from L2Beat API
├── fetch-staking.ts       # Validator counts from Beaconcha.in
└── ...

src/data/
├── timeline.ts            # Events (manual + generated)
├── gas-history.json       # Pre-fetched gas prices per block
├── eth-prices.json        # Pre-fetched ETH/USD prices
├── blob-stats.json        # Pre-fetched blob data
└── ...
```

**For contributors:**
- `npm run fetch-data` — regenerate all static data files
- Scripts are documented with API sources
- No API keys needed at runtime (only for data regeneration)
- CI can periodically refresh data

### Backend (Rust) — Future
- API aggregating/caching sources
- Block ↔ timestamp conversion
- Search/browse endpoints

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Timeline UI
- Animation layer
- Audio player
- Live block feed (only exception: real-time blocks)

### Principles
- Links > copies (point to canonical sources)
- Block numbers as primary index
- Phased delivery (always shippable)
- **Pre-populate data, easy regeneration**

## Operating Model

1. **Work async** — nights/heartbeats
2. **Surface decisions cleanly** — A/B options with visuals
3. **Don't go too far** — check in on big decisions
4. **Keep docs updated** — this file, VISION.md
